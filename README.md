### Problem Description ###

After the nuclear war, a strange and deadly virus has infected the planet. Living creatures
are becoming zombies that spread their zombiness by an unfriendly bite. The world consists
of an ​ n ​ x​ n ​ grid on which ​ zombies​ ​ and ​ creatures​ live.

Both of these occupy a single square on the grid and can be addressed using zero-indexed
x-y coordinates. Top left corner is ​ (x: 0, y: 0)​ with x represent horizontal coordinate, y
represent vertical coordinate. Any number of zombies and creatures may occupy the same
grid square.

At the beginning of the program, a single zombie awakes and begins to move around the
grid. It is given an initial x-y coordinate and a list of movements, up, down, left and right. E.g.
(​ U ​ , ​ D ​ , ​ L ​ , ​ R ​ ).
